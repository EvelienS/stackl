# STACKL

**STACKL** is an open-source software platform that enables users to flexibly model, describe, and automate their application automation strategy.

STACKL supports transparent and flexible application orchestration by:

*   forming the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) of application configuration data for the available IT environment(s)
*   decoupling data, automation, and platforms and simplifying automated infrastructure management for code and configuration tooling
*   providing a data lookup store for your IT configuration data including infrastructure resources, application definitions, and their desired services

In essence, it allows to Model, Describe, and Automate your application orchestration workflow. This unburdens users from manually choosing fitting IT infrastructure, stitching together applications out of heterogeneous services, and picking suitable orchestration tools, each time they want to deploy their projects. Users now simply model their available infrastructure, describe their desired applications, and specify the desired orchestration tools once. STACKL will then transparantly and autonomously use this information to correctly and efficiently orchestrate and automate applications across their lifetime and any changes to either them or their IT environment.

# Acknowledgments

STACKL was initially created for in-house use by a DevOps company, [Nubera](https://www.nubera.eu/), who saw the need for platform to better provide  services to clients. After some time, it became clear that STACKL could be useful to the general DevOps community as well so the decision was made to spin it off as an open source project.
Hence, thanks to Nubera  and @Yannick Struyf who put in much of the hard initial work.
