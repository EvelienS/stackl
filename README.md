# STACKL

**STACKL** is an open-source software platform that enables users to flexibly model, describe, and automate their application orchestration.

STACKL supports the automated configuration, coordination, and management of applications and IT infrastructure by:

*   forming the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) configuration data lookup store for your IT environment including infrastructure resources, application definitions, and their characteristics and services
*   decoupling configuration data, automation strategy, and deployment targets thereby simplifying the automated infrastructure management for code and configuration tooling
*  enabling the use of pluggable modules for critical backend systems, such as processing and data storage, to flexibly support different scalability and performance requirements

In essence, it allows to Model, Describe, and Automate your application orchestration workflow. Users are saved from  manual work each time they want to deploy their projects by automating and simplifying IT infrastructure selection, application specification, and choosing suitable orchestration tools. Users now simply model their available infrastructure, describe their desired applications, and specify the desired orchestration tools once. STACKL then transparantly and autonomously uses this information to correctly and efficiently orchestrate and automate applications in the available IT environment across their lifetime and managing dynamic changes.

# Acknowledgments

STACKL was initially created for in-house use by a DevOps company, [Nubera](https://www.nubera.eu/), who saw the need for platform to better provide  services to clients. After some time, it became clear that STACKL could be useful to the general DevOps community as well so the decision was made to spin it off as an open source project.
Hence, thanks to Nubera  and @Yannick Struyf who put in much of the hard initial work.
